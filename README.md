This repository contains solutions to common  problems in Python, covering fundamental concepts like searching, sorting, frequency counting, shifting, rotations, duplicates handling, and more.

These problems are widely asked in coding interviews and university assignments, and serve as excellent practice for beginners and intermediates in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
